## 🆕 New Features

We’ve added **important updates** to make classroom management faster and clearer:

1️⃣ **Student Count by Gender in Each Section**  
- See at a glance how many **male and female students** are in each section.  
- When a section is empty: `(🧑/👧): 0`  
- When there are students: `(🧑: 2 | 👧: 3)`  

2️⃣ **Color-Coded Section Status**  
- **Red** box if the section is empty  
- **Green** box if the section has one or more students  

These features help teachers:

- Quickly identify active and empty sections  
- Track the number of students by gender without opening each profile  
- Improve classroom organization and focus on sections needing attention  

3️⃣ **Direct Call to Parent Feature**  
- Add a phone number for each student’s parent ✅  
- Open a student card and see the parent’s number immediately  
- Click the 📞 button next to the number to call directly without saving it in your phone  

💡 **Tip:** These visual indicators and quick access tools save time and make managing multiple sections much easier for teachers and professors!
